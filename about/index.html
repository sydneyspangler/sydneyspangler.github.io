	<h1>about</h1>
	<p>Hi! I'm Sydney! I'm a storyteller, linguist, and book nerd. My academic interests include digital gaming rhetoric, print history, and ecolinguistics. I'm also an avid fan of comic book/graphic novel design, gaming, and visual media. You can also find me in the TX Master Composter-Gulf Coast Chapter scene!</p> 
	<p>If you'd like to connect with me on potential collaborations, work, or various other inquiries, please email me at spangler.sydney@gmail.com. I'd love to hear from you!</p>
