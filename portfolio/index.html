	<p>My professional interests include content writing, copy editing, publishing production, design thinking, and social media strategy.</p>
	<p>I currently lead social media operations at Texas Master Composter-Coastal Bend Chapter, community-based program of citizen education and volunteer development to promote cost-effective and eco-responsible yard-care and food waste practices. I also write for the Office of Marketing and Communications at Texas A&M University-Corpus Christi and provide writing assistance to writers of all levels across higher education. Previously, I was the managing editor of Windward Review, an annual literary journal that showcases narratives unique to South Texas, the Coastal Bend, and border regions.</p>
